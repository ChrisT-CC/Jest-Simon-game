# Simon Game

This is a JS memory game, based on the [electronic Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) from  the 1980s.

The game will flash the  circles in a random sequence and then you must click on the circles to match the sequence. If you get it right, you get a point and move onto the next round.
